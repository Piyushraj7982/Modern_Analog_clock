Analog Clock with Digital Clock Overlay
This project is a simple yet elegant demonstration of combining traditional analog clock mechanics with the functionality of a digital clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Overview
In this project, we've created a visually appealing analog clock with hour, minute, and second hands, designed to mimic the classic look of traditional timepieces with gradient color. Additionally, we've incorporated a digital clock overlay that displays the current time in a modern digital format.

Features
Analog Clock: The analog clock is built using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. JavaScript is used to dynamically update the position of the clock hands to reflect the current time.

Digital Clock Overlay: The digital clock overlay is implemented using JavaScript to fetch the current time from the system clock and display it in a digital format on top of the analog clock.

Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be responsive, ensuring that the clock remains visually appealing and functional across various screen sizes and devices.

Usage
To use this project, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. The analog clock will start ticking, displaying the current time along with the digital clock overlay.
